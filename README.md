# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The final project of the course of R - Getting and Cleaning Data

This file has the instructions on how to run the dataset.

The data set is Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set
In this Repo we have:

- Codebook.md -> A code book with the description of the variables, the data and any transformations in the work i made to clean the data.
- run_analysis.R -> This is the R program of the project. This program was made following the 5 steps required in the project:
    * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- FinalData.txt -> Is the final data obtained after export.
